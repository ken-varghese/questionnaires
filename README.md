# 🧩 wemolab Questionnaires

**wemolab questionnaires** is an open repository of structured and versioned research questionnaires  
developed by **[WEMO Lab](https://wemolab.eu/)** and collaborators in scientific and participatory mobility studies.

It serves as a public archive for survey instruments used in research on mobility, environment, and urban behaviour,  
designed for **transparency**, **interoperability**, and **scientific reproducibility**.

> 🧠 These questionnaires are designed to be fully compatible with the **[PlanEasy framework](https://github.com/planeasy)**,
